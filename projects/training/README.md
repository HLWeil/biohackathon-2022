This page describes the "Mapping the training journey in Bioinformatics" project for the 1st de.NBI /
ELIXIR Germany BioHackathon.

## Abstract

We aim at mapping the “training journey” of different personas in Bioinformatics, visualising the steps needed to acquire expert knowledge in each topic, or skill. The focus of the project will be to link the steps with available training materials/events, with comments on their quality, accessibility and potential integration. This will allow (i) mapping the relationship/dependencies between open training content and (ii) identifying areas where training materials should be developed/enhanced by the community.

## Topics

Provide a list of topics of your project

* Training
* FAIR
* Open source

## Expected audience

Add your expected audience / contributors here:

* We welcome any training enthusiast willing to work on classifying the available (open) training offer.
* We also encourage people to join to develop the technical platform through which this data will be hosted/visualised and future contributions will be collected. 

## Hacking topics

Add your hacking topics here.



## Communication

Add information about the project slack channel here and / or contact information

* Project lead: Lisanna Paladin <lisanna.paladin@embl.de>, Pablo Mier <munoz@uni-mainz.de>
* [Project plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dr1tMZiHpzCxKkbb13cNGHga08FcUWmK_lBHDLjAGEM): all info is linked from here.

## Possible outcomes

* Some examples of training journeys, including:
  * Description of persona 
  * Description of the steps in the training path, each step corresponding to one or multiple standalone short course (few days) or module (one day or less)
  * Links to open teaching or learning materials to complete the step
* (Not mandatory, depends on the skills of people joining the BioHackathon) The repository to store the collected data and the tool to visualise training journeys, also allowing future contributions to be integrated
